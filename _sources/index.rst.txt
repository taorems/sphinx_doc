   This documentation is built using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_. The source code is hosted on GitHub.
   Sphinx supports documenting code objects in several languages, namely Python, C, C++, JavaScript, and reStructuredText. Each of them can be documented using a series of directives and roles grouped by domain.
